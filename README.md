# Timbre

A physics-driven timbre exploration tool that resynthesizes audio fragments and maps them into an interactive 2D timbre space.

This project is inspired by [Minuit Solstice](https://minuit.am/), a novel synthesizer VST that uses spectral analysis and timbre-based organization to extend and resynthesize small audio fragments from a user-provided sound file.

Audio is decomposed into short spectral frames, analyzed for timbral features, and embedded into a 2D timbre space where nearby points correspond to perceptually similar sounds. These fragments can be continuously extended and resynthesized, allowing navigation through timbre rather than time.

The project extends this idea by introducing physics-based interaction: sound fragments behave as objects within simulated fields and forces, enabling dynamic, emergent playback behaviors driven by motion and interaction within the timbre map.
